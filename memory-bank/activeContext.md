# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Session Focus
**Date**: January 7, 2025
**Primary Task**: Creating comprehensive Cline rules with file size checking functionality

## Recent Changes
- Created `.clinerules` file with file size management protocol
- Established memory bank structure for project intelligence
- Implemented tiered file size checking system with user alerts
- Set up project-specific patterns for MCFax application

## Current Work Status
- ‚úÖ `.clinerules` file created with comprehensive file size checking
- ‚úÖ Memory bank directory structure established
- ‚úÖ Project brief documented
- üîÑ Currently building out remaining memory bank files
- ‚è≥ Need to complete system patterns and tech context documentation

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### File Size Management
- Implemented 4-tier system: Safe (< 50KB), Caution (50-200KB), Permission (200-500KB), Danger (> 500KB)
- PowerShell-specific commands for Windows environment
- User interaction patterns for large file handling
- Context window usage monitoring

### Memory Bank Strategy
- Core files approach for essential project intelligence
- Modular structure allowing for project-specific additions
- Clear update triggers and maintenance workflows

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining memory bank files:
   - systemPatterns.md (architecture and design patterns)
   - techContext.md (technology stack and constraints)
   - productContext.md (product goals and user experience)
   - progress.md (current status and roadmap)

2. Test file size checking functionality in practice
3. Refine alert templates based on usage
4. Document project-specific patterns as they emerge

## Context for Future Sessions
This session established the foundation for intelligent file handling and project context management. The `.clinerules` file now provides comprehensive guidance for file size checking, preventing context window overflow issues that were previously problematic.

The memory bank structure will serve as the knowledge base for understanding the MCFax application across sessions, ensuring continuity and informed decision-making.

## Key Insights Discovered
- MCFax is a mature fax application with extensive test coverage
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Windows-specific development environment requiring PowerShell commands
- Large file handling is critical for PDF processing workflows
